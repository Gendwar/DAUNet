# Deep Learning-Based Neuron Counting for Mesoscopic Brain Connectivity Study in Macaques
Accurate enumeration and localization of macaque neurons labeled by neuronal tracers are crucial for quantitatively assessing brain connectivity patterns and constructing a mesoscopic brain connectome atlas. However, methodological challenges and limitations in dataset construction impede this scientific progress. In this project, we constructed a dataset of Macaque Fluorescently Labeled Neurons (MFN) obtained through retrograde neuronal tracing experiments on three rhesus macaque brains. This dataset, comprised of 1600 images and collaboratively annotated by six experts, generated 33,411 neuron annotations. Leveraging this dataset, we developed a cell counting model, Dense Convolutional Attention U-Net (DAUNet).

*MFN dataset*: In this project, we temporarily publicize 50 fluorescent neuron images of rhesus monkeys and their annotation information, and we will publicize all the datasets with the code after the publication of the article.
